				<p>I grew up in southeast China where the average household goes to the market to buy fresh ingredients and cooks a balanced spread of rice or noodles, fish, and vegetables for dinner every day. Although I left that lifestyle halfway through elementary school, my mom does her best to continue her own take on our old traditions to this day. She is the queen of meal prepping, often looking ahead to the next week as she prepares the current weeks meals. She makes soups, rice porridge dishes, stir-fries, stews -- everything. Every day.</p>
						
				<p>So to say the least, I grew up around those who loved food and love to be creative with it.</p>
						
				<p>There's no arguing that I've naturally acquired the passion of creating with food. I love trying out new recipes and experimenting with unfamiliar ingredients. Due to my Chinese influence and background, much of what I make is characteristic of the food I grew up with. Making food that reflects my story is the easiest way for me to create a home away from home no matter where I am in the world.</p>
