						<p>Chicken biryani is a chicken and rice styled dish, which is widely popular in India and 
						Pakistan. Because of its lengthy preparation <br> 
						time, most people choose to pay for the dish itself rather than making it at home. Due to 
						the amount of time it takes to make the dish, <br> 
						it tends to be reserved for special occasions like weddings, parties, or holidays. The dish 
						itself tends to be very heavy, so it is usually <br> 
						only eaten for dinner. While the dish is not vegetarian, it can be adapted to make it one.</p>

				<h3>Instruction</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>In a large skillet, fry potatoes in 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil until brown, and 
					put aside.</li>
					<li>Add the remaining oil to the skillet and fry the onion, garlic and ginger until 
					the onion is soft and golden.<br>
					Add tomatoes, chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, and salt. Fry the mixture for 5 minutes,
					stirring contantly.</li>
					<li>Add yogurt, mint, cardamom, and the 2 inch piece cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over 
					low heat, stirring occasionally until<br>
					the tomatoes are cooked. If the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan,
					add a little hot water.</li>
					<li>When the mixture is thick and smooth, add the chicken pieces and stir.</li>
					<li>Cover and cook over low heat until the chicken is tender (30-45 minutes). There should
					only be a little thick gravy<br>
					left. In necessary, cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>

					<li>In a lark skillet, heat the 2 1/2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and fry the onions until 
					they are golden. Add saffron,<br>
					cardomom, cloves, cinnamon stick, ginger, and rice. Stir until the rice is coated with spices.</li>
					<li>In a medium pot, heat the chicken stock and salt. When the mixture is hot, pour it over the 
					rice and stir well.</li>
					<li>Add the chicken mixture and the potatoes, and gently mix them into the rice. Bring it to a boil.</li>
					<li>Cover the saucepan, turn the heat to low, and steam for 20 minutes. Do not lift the lid or stir.
					Spoon the biryani onto a warm <br> 
					serving dish.</li>
