				This year marks the first year since the beginning of my college career that I'm living off-campus. To accommodate for this change and to save a little cash, I also decided to take myself off of the meal plan. But with a full class load, multiple on-campus jobs and additional work off-campus, how did I plan to cook all my meals either on time or ahead of time? The answer came in the form of an essential kitchen appliance -- the Crockpot! Here's how to make my go-to soup for these first couple months of school when illnesses are floating around in the air and catching something nasty is almost inevitable.

				<h3>Instructions</h3>
			
				<ol id="instructions">
					<li>In a 6 quart Crockpot, place the chicken on the bottom and top with, potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, garlic, olive oil, thyme and bay leaf.</li>
					<li>Next add in water (and chicken broth), cover and cook on low heat 8-10 hours.</li>
					<li>Switch to high heat for 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally. The chicken should be pretty easy to break up by now. Doing so will ensure even cooking throughout. </li>
					<li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
