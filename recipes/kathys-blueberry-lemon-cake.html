		<p> This is one of my favorite desserts for a summer's day, brought to you from my mother's personal recipe notes. She made it in early August with handpicked blueberries that we had collected from a local orchard. The light and sugary frosting is my mother's own recipe, while the cake batter was adapted from Lindsay Funston's recipe, as linked below. The cake's flavor gets better with age, and is at its prime after a day of refrigeration, accompanied by an iced tea.</p>
